# hSynTurboRibo
- Short read bulk WT P0
  - These are “input” and “final” WT samples similar to the ones you analyzed previously. Each mouse has a corresponding input and final sample (e.g., mouse WP_1 has a WP_1_input and WP_1_final sample. The inputs contain transcripts from all the cell types in the brain, before any kind of enrichment. The finals are the RNA from the Ribotag immunoprecipitation which we expect to be enriched for neuronal transcripts. The goal of this batch of sequencing was just to demonstrate that we got strong and specific neuronal enrichment in our system.
- Short read bulk PS19 P0
  - This is similar to the short read bulk WT P0, except this cohort contains both PS19 (tau) and WT mice. The WTs here are a separate cohort from the WTs above. Each mouse also has a corresponding input and final sample. The goal here is to both show strong and specific neuronal enrichment, and to compare both the global and neuron-specific transcriptomes in tau vs. WT.
- snRNAseq PS19 P0
  - This is snRNAseq from 8 of the mice in the PS19 P0 cohort. We did not do any cell/nuclei sorting beforehand, so multiple cell types should be present. We want to compare WT and PS19 neuronal transcriptomes, and see if there are any disease-specific signatures that are captured by Ribotag that are not captured by snRNAseq (and vice versa)
